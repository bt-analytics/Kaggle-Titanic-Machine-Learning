# Kaggle-Titanic-Machine-Learning

In this machine learning competition created by Kaggle, we explore the survivability of the famous Titanic sinking using a Jupyter Notebook on the Kaggle website, coded in Python. The training and test set are given by Kaggle and we will predict the survival chance based on the features in the dataset (age, sex, passenger class, title, city embarked, etc).

This, being my first project after basic Python courses online, was a challenging learning experience and gave me the opportunity to apply my data exploration experience in the first half of the project, as well as working through algorithm modeling and the functions associated with machine learning.

An outline of the project/submission are as follows:

data exploration

analysis

feature engineering

modeling

model evaluation and cross validation

hyperparameter tuning

submission
